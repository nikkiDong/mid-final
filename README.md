# 👁️ ClearVision Clinic — Ophthalmology Appointment Tracker

A full-stack patient appointment management portal for a multi-doctor ophthalmology clinic. Built as a two-phase academic project covering CRUD operations, role-based access, simulated AI, and real LLM integration.

---

## 📋 Project Overview

ClearVision Clinic is a scheduling portal that allows doctors to manage their availability and appointment statuses, while patients can book, reschedule, or cancel visits — all within a clean, role-aware interface tailored to ophthalmology workflows.

**Key differentiators from a generic appointment system:**
- Appointment types specific to eye care (routine vision check, glaucoma screening, fundus exam, etc.)
- Symptom intake form designed around common ophthalmic complaints (blurred vision, eye pain, floaters, photophobia)
- Follow-up reminder logic that suggests rechecks based on examination type

## 👥 User Roles

| Role | Permissions |
|---|---|
| **Doctor / Clinic Admin** | Create & delete time slots, view daily patient roster, update appointment status |
| **Patient** | Register & log in, browse open slots, book / cancel / reschedule appointments |

---

## 🗂️ Features

### Phase 1 — MVP (CRUD + Simulated AI)

**Doctor / Admin**
- Create and remove available time slots
- View the full daily patient roster
- Update appointment status: `Scheduled` → `Completed` or `No-Show`

**Patient**
- Register and log in with email
- Browse available slots filtered by doctor or date
- Book a specific time slot and receive a digital confirmation
- Cancel or reschedule an existing appointment
- Receive automated follow-up reminders based on exam type

**Simulated AI Chatbot** (5 hardcoded responses)

| Patient asks | System response |
|---|---|
| "When is my next appointment?" | Matches email to schedule, returns date & time |
| "What slots are available today?" | Filters and returns unclaimed time slots |
| "How do I cancel my appointment?" | Returns step-by-step instructions |
| "Which doctors are available?" | Lists doctors with open slots |
| "What should I prepare for my exam?" | Returns exam-specific preparation notes |

### Phase 2 — AI Integration & Scaling

**Real AI Clinic Assistant (LLM API)**
- Before booking, patients describe their symptoms in natural language (e.g., "my vision has been blurry on the left side and I've been seeing floaters")
- The LLM generates a concise, professional clinical brief
- The brief is automatically attached to the appointment record so the doctor is prepared before the patient arrives

**Additional Phase 2 improvements**
- OOP refactoring: `Doctor`, `Patient`, `Appointment`, and `TimeSlot` classes
- UI iteration based on peer feedback
- Intelligent follow-up reminders: AI suggests optimal recheck intervals based on exam type (e.g., 3 months for glaucoma patients)
